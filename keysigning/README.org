#+TITLE: Key-signing scripts

These scripts are to make exporting key signatures easier.

Run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./export_keys_signed_by.sh $your_key
#+END_SRC

This will export all keys you have signed to a folder.
=signed_keys/$email= for each key.

Then run your favourite email client and attach:
    - signed_key.asc :: encrypted key for recipient
    - msg.asc :: encrypted instructions for recipient

The recipient is then free to upload their signed keys to a keyserver, if they
choose to do so.

This is done by running the following on their end.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gpg -d signed_key.asc | gpg --import
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key $their_key
#+END_SRC
